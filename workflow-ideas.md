# Ideas to Streamline the Assignment Completion Workflow

- Be careful not to spend time on tangents that don't contribute to the assignments, keep a list of things to come back to for further investigation or questions when time permits. ([See my list here](TODO))
- Find ways to organize by assignment.  Perhaps putting each assignment on its own desktop could help.
- Save browser windows now in use as per window saved sessions and close them.
- Open pages in browser locally.  Don't commit every change.  Development cycles should be fast.
