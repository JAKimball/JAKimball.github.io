# Ideas to Streamline the Assignment Completion Workflow

- Work on making development cycles as fast as possible.  Open pages in the browser locally.  Don't commit every change.  
- Be careful not to spend time on tangents that don't directly contribute to the assignments, keep a list of things to come back to for further investigation or questions when time permits. ([See my list here](TODO))
- Stay caught up with class (or ahead where possible).  It works best of your reading and lab work are in line with the lecture and class activities, and you will not have to juggle multiple assignments at once.
- If you do get behind, find ways to organize by assignment.  Perhaps putting each assignment on its own desktop could help.
- Clear the your laptop of all distracting applications and windows.
- Save unrelated browser windows and tabs currently in use as per window saved sessions and close them.  The Vivaldi browser is the only one I'm aware of that is currently able to do this with full fidelity.  (Full tab history lists and page states are preserved, not just tab bookmarks.)
