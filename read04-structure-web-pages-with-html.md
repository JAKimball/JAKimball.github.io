## The process for creating a wireframe for a site

- Who is the website for?
  - Is it targeted at individuals or companies?

Think about the target audience and what they will want from the site.

Understand your audience.
Why? Who? What? How Often?

1. What are their general motivations?  Entertainment or specific goal?  Personal or Professional? Time spent on site essential or luxury?
2. What are their specific goals?  Education, research (general or specific). 

- What are their motivations?
  - Are they looking for general entertainment or a specific goal?
  - Is it personal or professional?
  - Is time on the site essential or a luxury?
  
- What are their specific goals?
  - Do they want general information for research or are they looking for something specific?
  - Are they already familiar with the service or product?
  - Are they looking for time sensitive information?

Identify what information your visitors will need to meet their goals.

- Prioritize levels of information: Key points to non-essential details.

Determine how often people will visit and how often the site should be updated.
