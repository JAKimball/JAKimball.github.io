## To do after assignments (or "lower priority To Do's")

- Fix the `.profile` file...
  - Fix the colors
  - Remove the automatic `cd` to the working directory since this interferes with Windows Explorer context menu `(Shift-Right-Click on folder - "Open Linux shell here")`
- Consider reinstalling VSCODE. Make sure to back up settings first.
- Learn about adding [SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) to my GitHub account.
