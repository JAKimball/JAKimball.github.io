# Read 08: Computer Architecture & Logic

## My Notes From the [*How Computers Work* Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

Computers are tools ment to solve problems with thinking work rather than manual work.

## Four different tasks common to all computers

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears.  Over time they have continually become smaller and faster.

## Binary and Data

The binary number system is a base 2 system of 1s and 0s used to electronically represent information on the wires of computers.

Text, images, and sound are all also represented with binary numbers.

- Images are broken down into pixels with a numbers for red, green, and blue for each pixel.
- Sound is represented as waveforms with numbers for each point along the waveform.

## Circuits and Logic

Circuits can make up many types of logic gates.

### Logic Gates

- And
- Nand
- Not
- Nor
- Or
- Xor

By connecting these basic circuits together more complex circuits can be built to preform more complex calculations.

For example a more complex circuit can be an adder.  A basic adder will combine two input bits and produce two output bits.  Multiple adder circuits can be combined side-by-side to produce larger adders for adding larger numbers.

In similar ways, other electrical circuits can perform other operations such as subtraction and multiplication.

All information processing done by a computer is just many, many simple operations put together.

### Smaller Equals Faster

The smaller a circuit is, the less distance an electrical signal has to go.  Electrical charges propagate at nearly the speed of light.

## CPU, Memory, Input, and Output

1. Input devices convert physical input to binary information
2. Memory stores the binary information
3. CPU - The Central Procession Unit calculates information
4. Output converts information to physical output

## Hardware and Software

### Software

Software is the code that runs on the hardware.

The CPU is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer.  It has circuits for math and logic and circuits to send and receive to and from the other parts of the computer.  

Binary code is the most basic form of software, however now higher level languages are almost always used when writing software.  High level commands are converted into hundreds or thousands of simpler binary commands operated on by the hardware of the CPU.

### Operation System

The computer **operating system** (OS) is the master program that manages how software uses the computer hardware.

The operation system is able to control the other software on the computer.  It lets you install programs and decides when they are run and controls how they access the input and output devices.  The operating system quickly switches between programs to allow them to share the CPU for fractions of a second to allow many programs to appear to run at once.
